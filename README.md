# A Simple Flask Blog - Final Project
This repo creates a simple Flask blog as seen in the [Fromzero](https://www.udemy.com/python-flask-course/) course.

## Final Project Overview
During the course, the basics of a simple Flask blog were created. The final project requires additional functionality to be added: commenting. As discussed in the video, a user should be able to register with the blog and be able to submit comments for each blog post.

# Notes about this repo
At the time of writing, the course no longer recommends using Cloud9 and is in the process of updating the videos to consistently follow a local development environment. My machine was already set up using Anaconda (specifially Miniconda) instead of pip as my Python package manager. The included venv/environments.yml file can by used by Anaconda to create a virtual environment appropriate for the code.

`conda env create -f venv/environment.yml`
